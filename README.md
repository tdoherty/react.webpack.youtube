react.webpack.youtube
=====================

A youtube emulator written to learn React and Webpack. I like to remove the problem domain from the equation when learning a new technology, so I've written
a series of youtube emulators with different tools and frameworks. This allows me to focus on how each technology solves the same problem, much like a ToDo only with a
slightly more involved problem domain.

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```


### Linting

This boilerplate project includes React-friendly ESLint configuration.

```
npm run lint
```
